This story, while attempting to explore the themes of spirituality and scientific discovery, falls prey to many common pitfalls of novice writing. It reads like a summary of a story, not a story itself.  Here's a brutal but hopefully constructive critique:

**1.  Show, Don't Tell: A Drowning in Exposition**

* **The Problem:** The narrative is overwhelmingly reliant on telling instead of showing.  Every sentence feels like a description, a summary of feelings or events, rather than an immersive experience.
* **Example:** "The Bay of Bengal, a vast expanse of churning waters, was no stranger to storms." This is telling us about the bay, not showing it.
* **Solution:**  Instead of stating "Anya felt a deep connection," show her reaction. Describe the sensation of the storm, the salt spray, the sound of the wind. How does her body react? How does the storm's energy manifest to her senses?

**2.  Dialogue: A Missing Voice**

* **The Problem:** The story lacks engaging dialogue. The characters' thoughts and feelings are communicated through narration, but their voices are missing.  The dialogue that exists is bland and functional, not revealing character or furthering the plot.
* **Example:** "They called themselves the 'Temple Keepers,' guardians of the island's secrets, protectors of its ancient wisdom." This is a narrator telling us what they are called, rather than a character saying it, experiencing it, or reacting to it.
* **Solution:**  Create conversations that reveal the personalities of the Temple Keepers and Anya.  How do they react to each other? What do they disagree on? What do their exchanges reveal about their cultures and values?

**3.  Narrative: A Lost Path**

* **The Problem:** The story lacks a compelling narrative arc. It reads more like a series of disconnected events rather than a journey driven by conflict and stakes.
* **Example:** Anya finds the temple, finds the villagers, learns about their practices.  There's no real tension, no conflict, no sense of urgency.
* **Solution:** What drives Anya? What are the risks she faces?  What are the obstacles she encounters? What does she fear losing? What does she hope to gain? Give the reader a reason to care about her choices and the outcome of her journey.

**4.  Clunky Language and Clichés:**

* **The Problem:** The language is often clunky and formulaic. Phrases like "insatiable thirst for knowledge," "a strange sense of anticipation," and "a deep sense of belonging" are overused and lack originality.
* **Solution:** Choose vivid, sensory language to evoke the island's atmosphere and Anya's experiences. Don't be afraid to experiment with metaphors and similes to create a unique and memorable world. 

**5.  Superficial Understanding of Tantra and Shiva**

* **The Problem:** While the story attempts to incorporate elements of Shiva and Tantric practices, it feels superficial and based on stereotypes. 
* **Example:** "The Temple Keepers, through their mastery of this ancient practice, could heal themselves and their environment, their bodies humming with an energy that pulsed through the island."  This feels more like a description of a power fantasy than a nuanced understanding of Tantric practices.
* **Solution:** Do thorough research on Tantra and Shiva. Understand the diverse philosophies and practices associated with them, their symbolism, and the historical context. This will allow you to integrate these elements authentically into the story, avoiding clichés and stereotypes. 

**Overall, the story needs a complete rewrite. Focus on showing, not telling.  Give the reader a compelling narrative arc, create compelling characters with distinct voices, and use language that brings the story to life.  Research the spiritual elements to avoid superficiality and inaccuracy. This story has the potential to be much more than a summary of events. It can be a journey of discovery, a clash of cultures, and a compelling exploration of the human spirit.**
